Images exported as SVG from Glyph Drawing Club are a bit messy, but cleaning up the files is fast and easy. Follow these steps:

![Export as SVG](assets/cleanup1.png "Export as SVG")

* Export your glyph drawing as .svg
* Open the .svg in Adobe Illustrator
* Select the Selection Tool (`V`) and press `Cmd + a` to select everything
* Open Pathfinder window (Window -> Pathfinder)
* Open Pathfinder options which you find by clicking the hamburger menu icon

![Open pathfinder options](assets/cleanup3.png "Open pathfinder options")

* Make sure "Remove Redundant Points" is checked, click OK

![The precision number should be left at default](assets/cleanup4.png "The precision number should be left at default")

* Click Merge (make sure all paths are selected) **TWICE** and then close Pathfinder window

![Click the merge button twice!](assets/cleanup5.png "Click the merge button twice!")

## Make the background transparent (optional)

* Click off canvas, and select the Direct Selection Tool (`A`)
* Click on any white area, and go to Select -> Same -> Fill Color

![This selects all shapes that have white fill color](assets/cleanup4-1.png "This selects all shapes that have white fill color")

* Hit `delete` or `backspace`

![She's a happy clean dog now](assets/cleanup7.png "She's a happy clean dog now")

* Your drawing is now cleaned up with a transparent background!

From here it's easier for you to make adjustments to the paths and use the vectors in production.
